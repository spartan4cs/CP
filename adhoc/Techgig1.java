// Virus Outbreak (100 Marks)
// In the Martian land faraway, a new virus has evolved and is attacking the individuals at a fast pace. The scientists have figured out the virus composition, V. The big task is to identify the people who are infected. The sample of N people is taken to check if they are POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. A report is generated which provides the current blood composition B of the person. 

// POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ?

// If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.

// Example:

// Virus Composition, V = coronavirus

// Blood Composition of the person , B = ravus

// The person in question is POSITIVE as B is the subsequence of the V. 

// The scientists are busy with their research for medicine and request you to build a program which can quickly figure out if the person is POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. They will provide you with the virus composition V and all the peopleâ€™s current blood composition. Can you help them?

// Note: The virus and blood compositions are lowercase alphabet strings.

// Input Format
// The first line of the input consists of the virus composition, V

// The second line of he input consists of the number of people, N

// Next N lines each consist of the blood composition of the ith person, Bi

// Constraints
// 1<= N <=10

// 1<= |B|<= |V|<= 10^5

// Output Format
// For each person, print POSITIVE or NEGATIVE in a separate line

// Sample TestCase 1
// Input
// coronavirus
// 3
// abcde
// crnas
// onarous
// Output
// NEGATIVE
// POSITIVE
// NEGATIVE
