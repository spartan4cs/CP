I. Far Manager: advanced settings.
===============================================================================
   This section describes the advanced technical information, not  included  in
the main help file, that is actual for the current Far Manager version.



=====================
  1.1. General/miscellaneous.
=====================


1.1.0.(TechInfo #0)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Key "/u <username>"
   The  data   from  [HKCU\Software\Far Manager]     is     copied     into
   [HKCU\Software\Far Manager\Users]  only if the following registry branch
   doesn't exist:
   [HKCU\Software\Far Manager\Users\<username>]. Only the following branches
   are not copied:
   [HKCU\Software\Far Manager\Users] and [HKCU\Software\Far Manager\PluginsCache].
   That means that changing parameters  described  below  will  not  affect
   existing user profiles.  Setting  for  "<username>"  should  be  changed
   relative to the branch [HKCU\Software\Far Manager\Users\<username>].



II. Windows: settings that apply to Far Manager.
===============================================================================
   This section describes the additional technical information  that  has  some
appliance to Far Manager.


2.0.(TechInfo #57)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   If the  [HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Directory\shellex\CopyHookHandlers]  registry
   key is empty Far removes it when started.
   If this key is empty then Far will crash  when  deleting  files  to  the
   recycle bin.

2.1.(TechInfo #58)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop]
   "AutoEndTasks":REG_DWORD
   System: Automatically Close Hung Applications.
   This option is used to force Windows to automatically close without  any
   warning applications that have hung.

   Can be one of the following values:
     0 - off.
     1 - allow to automatically close hung applications.
   Default value is 0 (off).

   Setting the key to "1" allows to eliminate the problem  of  closing  the
   internal modal editor (e.g. editing a file inside an archive) using  the
   standard "Close" button of the console window.
   For details see: http://www.winguides.com/registry/display.php/199/

2.2.(TechInfo #59)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor]
   "DisableUNCCheck":REG_DWORD
   (applies only to NT4/2k/XP/2003/Vista/2008 and cmd.exe)
   The CMD.EXE normally disallows UNC names from being used for the current
   directory. When Far tries to execute a command of  the  command  process
   and the current path is UNC then the following  error  message  will  be
   written to the console:

     "CMD.EXE was started with the above path as the current directory.
     UNC paths are not supported.  Defaulting to Windows directory."

   (the output might be different for NT4/W2k/XP/2003/Vista/2008)

   The key "DisableUNCCheck" allows to resolve this problem.
   The following values can be used:
     0 - output a warning message and set the  current  path  to  Windows
         system folder.
     1 - output no warning and try to set the current path to the UNC path.

   The default value is 0.
   Recommended value is 1.
